This repo is a good place to start trying out ideas in Cycle.js. It works with Node 6 and the latest versions of Evergreen browsers. There is no build step, no source maps and no CDNs so it works offline. 

You can use the Chrome DevTools [workspace](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/setup/setup-workflow?hl=en) to edit right in the browser. Changes are picked up without reloading (no file watching or extra scripts needed).

It's not meant for production apps; you'll probably want to or use [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) or [transpile](https://babeljs.io/) recent JavaScript features for older browsers .
